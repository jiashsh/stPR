Reference: 
“Distinct neural coupling dynamics across different brain regions and states” 
by Shanshan Jia, Ziwei Yin, Zhaofei Yu, Jian K. Liu

## Basic environmental requirements:
Matlab


## Steps:

Run popul_2c1hsp_stPR_spike_crossArea_git.m



## Datasets:

V1CA1M1_anaesthesia_spontaneous.mat and V1CA1M1_awake_spontaneous.mat are the inferred spike signals of V1 CA1 M1 under anesthesia and awake state, respectively
